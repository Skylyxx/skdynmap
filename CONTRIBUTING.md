## Get Started

You can contribute to this repo with [issues](#issue) and [pull request](#pull-request).
- [Issue](#issue): Please use issue to report a bug or suggest a new feature.
- [Pull request](#pull-request): You can use pull request to contribute to SkDynmap, with your own code.

### Issue

To create an issue, it's really simple: go to the [issues page](https://github.com/Skylyxx/skdynmap/issues), and click on "New issue" button. Next, choose the adequate template, or click on `Open a blank issue` if you don't know what to choose. Specify a title, and start writing your issue. Finally, click on "Submit new issue" to publish your issue. Thanks !

### Pull request

To create a pull request, you need to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo) first. Next, you can do your changes on your repo (It's better to create a new branch in your repo, to get better organized. Ex: `feature/improve-areas`).

Finally, if you think you made all required changes, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/Skylyxx/skdynmap/pulls), pointing to SkDynmap's `dev` branch. I will review your pull request, and ask for potentially new changes required. When everything looks good, I will merge your pull request into SkDynmap's `dev` branch. Thanks !
